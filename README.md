# BreakOut-Ball-Game 
Breakout Ball game is a widely used game which was developed in the 1970â€™s. In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all. A ball moves straight around the screen, bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen. When a brick I hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen; to prevent this from happening, the player has a horizontally movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play. The player uses the platform to keep the ball running. The goal is to break the bricks without missing the ball with your platform. 

The project makes use of **Java swing, OOPS concepts.**
Used new Java concepts like **AWT, Swing, JFrame, JPanel etc.**


## Functional components of the project
1. The player should be able to start the game in the terminal by pressing the ENTER key.
2. The player should be able to move the paddle sideways using the Leftwards and the Rightwards Arrow on the keyboard.
3. Once the player loses the ball, i.e. when the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends.
4. Breaking each brick provides the player a certain number of points.
5. Once the game ends, the terminal will present the final score of the player and give him the option to restart the game again.


# UML Diagrams


## Use Case Diagram-
A use case diagram is used to represent the dynamic behaviour of a system. It encapsulates the system's functionality by incorporating use cases, actors, and their relationships. Following are the purposes of a use case diagram given below:
1. It gathers the system's needs.
2. It depicts the external view of the system.
3. It recognizes the internal as well as external factors that influence the system.
4. It represents the interaction between the actors. 
Extend relationship: The use case is optional and comes after the base use case. It is represented by a dashed arrow in the direction of the base use case with the notation <<extend>>.
Include relationship: The use case is mandatory and part of the base use case. It is represented by a dashed arrow in the direction of the included use case with the notation <<include>>.
